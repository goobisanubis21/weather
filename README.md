The weather dashboard app is design to give a user friendly and simple experience to check the weather conditions in any searched area. Upon searching a certain area which gets displayed, the app allows user to see the current date, temp in Fahrenheit, humidity, wind speed and uv index. It also allows user to see the 5 day forecast for the searched area. All searches are prepended into a search history list that appears beneath the search bar which allows user to click on any old searches to quickly view all the data.
